   **Define the desired gameplay. What are you making?**
---
For the Digital Prototype course, we were assigned the task of creating _Mini-games for soon-to-be-launched arcade cabinets_. As a result, we were divided into groups of three, forming a total of 17 different groups. The final goal is to create a single project that includes each of the games.

The game's basics are simple: we need to create a 2-player game with a time limit of 30 or 60 seconds. The controls are defined by the type of arcade machine: an 8-way directional stick and 2 buttons, and the game must be in 3D.

The possible uses for these machines are:

-   College Open House
-   School visits to campus
-   Outreach events:
    -   Ontario College Fair
    -   Hamilton Comic Con

Based on these concepts, we decided to create a ***shooter game with a top-down view,*** in which Player A must defeat Player B. The twist we added to this dynamic is that the ***walls bounce,*** so the player can use this as a strategy or it can become a disadvantage. Similarly, within the same map, there are walls for the player to hide behind if they choose, but these will be destroyed with a single hit. The time limit to win is 30 seconds, making it a short-term goal.

**Outline an objective statement for the design. What emotional and gameplay goals are you striving for with this design? Why?**
---
We wanted to establish a fundamental goal by considering the type of audience we wanted to target. This helped us think about the emotions we aimed to convey. In our case, the target audience is _families and young people looking to socialize and experience unique games they can't play at home_. With this concept in mind, we designed our idea—a shooter game with fast-paced and strategic gameplay, as we believed it would be the most effective way to generate excitement and joy during play.

**Detail design rationale. What do you envision? How does this support the overall project/company goal?**
---
We aimed to make the game accessible and appealing to the public without sacrificing the vibrancy that games can offer. For this reason, we used various design elements such as high contrast and warm-cool color contrasts to create engaging visuals when starting the game. We also wanted to incorporate glitch and pixel art concepts, which we found suitable for an arcade machine project, meeting the company's expectations while adding unique elements beyond the provided guidelines.

**Resume**
---

**Concept:**

The goal was to create a shooter game with a top-down view and bouncing walls that is dynamic, entertaining, and exciting.

**Game Structure:**

A base map with a green-white color contrast separates each player’s territory with a line in the center, allowing players to easily identify their side of the map.

**Players:**

A 2-player game where both players have the same abilities and limitations. Victory will depend on each player's use of strategy and tactics.

**Actions:**

Players must defeat their opponent while shooting and dodging different bullets, destroying walls, and navigating bouncing walls.

**Objective:**

Defeat your enemy within the 30-second time limit.
